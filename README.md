This is Rest API built using expressJs and MongoDB.
In this I have implemented user and task requests along with JWT authentication in Postman.
We can integrate this backend server with any of the frontend framwork to develop a web app.
If want to improve this or use this then after downloading, run the following command in your text editor (mine was VsCode)
command: "npm install"
